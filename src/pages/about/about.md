I'm **Konrad Hy≈ºy** and I am a self-taught web developer.

## Blog

The goal of this website is to share interesting insights focused mostly on the
web technologies, Internet and JavaScript. It is also a place where I document
my journey as a software craftsman. 

My blog is inspired by many fine thinkers that I have encountered while
browsing through the not-so-deep web. Some ideas might come as a build up on
the thoughts of others. After all, this is what this funny gig is all about:
standing on the shoulders of the giants, right?
